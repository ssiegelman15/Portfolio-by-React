            I am an aspiring full stack developer. This is my first attempt to
            build a portfolio page to showcase some of my work. I have over
            seven years of experience working in various roles at a few
            manufacturing companies. My most recent job is my current role as
            production engineer at a construction chemical company called Master
            Builders Solutions that specializes in the manufacturing of
            polyurethane products. Prior to that, I spent a little over two
            years working at the Coors brewery in Golden, CO and four years at a
            Phillips 66 oil refinery in Linden, NJ.
