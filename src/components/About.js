          I am an aspiring full stack developer. This is my first attempt to
          build a portfolio page with which to showcase some of my work.
          <br />
          <br />I have over seven years of experience working in various roles
          at a few manufacturing companies. My most recent job is my current
          role as manufacturing engineer at a construction chemical company
          specializing in polyurethane products called Master Builders
          Solutions. Prior to that, I spent a little over two years working at
          the Coors brewery in Golden, CO and four years at a Phillips 66 oil
          refinery in Linden, NJ.
